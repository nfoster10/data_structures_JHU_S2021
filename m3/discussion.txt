    1. Describe a scenario where you see recursion at play in your daily life.  What are some of the key features of this process or activity that make it recursive; reflect on the defining characteristics in the lecture.  For each example, how is this different from an iterative process.

    2. Describe a second and different scenario where you see recursion at play in your daily life.  What are some of the key features of this process or activity that make it recursive; reflect on the defining characteristics in the lecture.  For each example, how is this different from an iterative process.

    3. Are there any scenarios you can envision in which recursion would really be impossible, that the process is so iterative that you could not look at it recursively at all?

    4. What are some good, practical ways to organize your thoughts and ideas when working with recursion to manage the process a little more easily
