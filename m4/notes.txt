    Define a queue and the standard methods.
    Differentiate between the rules of the queue definition and implementation imposed restrictions.
    Characterize problems that have a FIFO characteristic, and give examples.
    Assess problems for appropriate use of queues, and make implementation recommendations.
    Discuss the pros and cons, including costs, of the three array based approaches to implementing a queue.
    Write a Queue ADT and Implement queues using arrays.
    Define a list and the standard methods.
    Differentiate between the rules of the list definition and implementation imposed restrictions.
    Characterize problems are appropriate to using a general list and a sorted list, and give examples.
    Assess problems for appropriate use of lists, and make implementation recommendations.
    Write a List ADT and implement lists using plain arrays, arrays using a “marked delete” strategy, and dynamic references (links).
    Rewrite list methods by imposing access restrictions, to obtain the standard stack and queue methods.
    Implement stacks and queues with dynamic references.
    Discuss the pros and cons, including costs, of each implementation type and each access restriction type and match to applications.
